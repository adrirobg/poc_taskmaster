# Session Context: TEP v2.4 Optimization Complete - Ready for Full Test

**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Focus:** TEP optimization from v2.3 to v2.4.3 with "think hard" mode

## Current State

✅ **TEP v2.4.3 optimized and merged to master**
- Reduced from 118 lines (v2.3) to 77 lines (v2.4)
- Changed from JSON to markdown artifacts
- Added "think hard" mode for optimal balance
- Principle established: "The TEP is a guide for the LLM, not a deterministic algorithm"

✅ **Context7 Integration validated**
- MCP connection working perfectly
- Library resolution tested (FastAPI: 1278 snippets, SQLAlchemy: 2476 snippets)
- Trust scores being used for selection
- Topics refined for specific queries

✅ **Test artifacts generated**
- `1-enriched.md` - Basic version (48 lines)
- `1-enriched-ultrathink.md` - Over-engineered (90 lines, 40% speculation)
- `1-enriched-think-hard.md` - Optimal (40 lines, includes Pydantic Settings)
- `1-enriched-balanced.md` - Manual balance attempt (47 lines)

## Critical Insights

1. **Think modes hierarchy discovered:**
   - `think` - Basic extended thinking
   - `think hard` - Optimal for TEP (chosen)
   - `think harder` - More computation
   - `ultrathink` - Maximum (causes over-engineering)

2. **Key improvements in v2.4:**
   - Detects Pydantic Settings (missed in basic mode)
   - Generates 12 focused TODOs vs 15 generic
   - Topics specific: "sqlite wal pragma" vs generic "engine configuration"
   - No premature patterns (avoided "unit of work" speculation)

3. **Philosophy shift:**
   - From deterministic script → flexible guide
   - From implementation → planning
   - From rigid JSON → natural markdown

## Next Steps Required

1. **Full workflow test with implementation:**
   - Execute `/task-enrich` on Task #1
   - Use generated artifact to create TODOs
   - Actually implement code following enriched plan
   - Validate Context7 value during coding

2. **Measure effectiveness:**
   - Time to complete task with/without TEP
   - Quality of implementation
   - Context7 documentation usage stats

3. **Potential refinements:**
   - Fine-tune "think hard" instructions if needed
   - Add metrics collection for TEP usage

## Technical Context

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/commands/task-enrich.md` - TEP v2.4.3 with "think hard"
- `.taskmaster/enriched/` - Multiple test artifacts
- `logs/tep-analysis/tep-v24-optimization-summary.md` - Full history

**Key Configuration:**
- TEP uses "think hard" mode
- 4 principles: Practical, Specific, Simple, 80/20
- Generates markdown artifacts in `.taskmaster/enriched/`

**Git Status:**
- Clean, all changes committed
- Merged to master from test/tep-v23-real-execution
- Ready for implementation test

## Session Recovery Instructions

When recovering this session:

1. **Read the optimization summary:**
   ```
   logs/tep-analysis/tep-v24-optimization-summary.md
   ```

2. **Review current TEP command:**
   ```
   .claude/commands/task-enrich.md
   ```

3. **Start full workflow test:**
   - Clear any test TODOs
   - Execute `/task-enrich` on Task #1
   - Follow enriched plan to implement
   - Document results

4. **Key context to remember:**
   - TEP is a guide, not a script
   - "think hard" is the optimal mode
   - Context7 IDs should be fetched just-in-time
   - Avoid over-engineering

**Ready to test:** The TEP v2.4.3 is optimized and ready for a complete implementation test to validate its effectiveness in real development workflow.
