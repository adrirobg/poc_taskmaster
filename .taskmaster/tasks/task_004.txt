# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create React Frontend Foundation and Routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Setup React application structure with TypeScript, routing, state management, and basic layout components
# Details:
Create React app structure with TypeScript strict mode, setup React Router for navigation, implement Zustand for state management.
