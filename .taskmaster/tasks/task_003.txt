# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build FastAPI CRUD Endpoints and Service Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RESTful API endpoints following OpenAPI 3.0 spec with proper validation, error handling, and repository pattern
# Details:
Create controller layer with endpoints for /api/v1/projects (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and /api/v1/notes with full CRUD operations. Implement service layer with business logic for project management, note creation/updates with auto-save every 500ms, and soft delete handling. Add repository layer for data access with proper error handling and validation using Pydantic v2 schemas. Include bulk operations endpoint for batch processing.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for all endpoints, test request/response validation, verify error handling with proper HTTP status codes, test bulk operations
