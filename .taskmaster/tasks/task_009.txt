# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Flexible Tagging System with Hierarchy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement hierarchical tag system with auto-completion, tag cloud visualization, and advanced filtering
# Details:
Create Tag model supporting hierarchical structure (#dev/python, #ideas/product) with parent-child relationships. Implement tag auto-completion with existing tag suggestions and hierarchy visualization. Build tag cloud interface for visual navigation with usage count indicators. Create tag management interface for merging, renaming, and organizing tags. Add tag-based filtering integration with search functionality and tag inheritance for hierarchical filtering.

# Test Strategy:
Test hierarchical tag creation and navigation, verify tag auto-completion accuracy, test tag cloud performance with large tag sets, validate tag filtering integration

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement hierarchical tag data model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database schema and models for hierarchical tag structure supporting parent-child relationships, tag metadata, and efficient querying
### Details:
Design tables for tags with parent_id foreign key, create indexes for performance, implement model classes with methods for tree traversal, ancestry paths, and subtree queries. Include fields for tag name, slug, description, usage count, and timestamps.

## 2. Build tag auto-completion API and frontend component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop backend endpoint for tag suggestions and create responsive auto-complete UI component with debouncing and hierarchical display
### Details:
Implement REST endpoint with fuzzy search, relevance scoring, and hierarchy-aware suggestions. Create React/Vue component with typeahead functionality, keyboard navigation, tag creation option, and visual hierarchy indicators. Include caching for performance.

## 3. Develop interactive tag cloud visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create dynamic tag cloud component showing tag popularity, relationships, and supporting interactive filtering with D3.js or similar library
### Details:
Build visualization showing tag sizes based on usage frequency, color coding for categories/hierarchy levels, hover effects showing related tags, click-to-filter functionality, and responsive layout. Include zoom/pan for large tag sets and export capabilities.

## 4. Implement comprehensive tag management interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create admin interface for CRUD operations on tags including bulk actions, hierarchy management, merging, and usage analytics
### Details:
Build management dashboard with tree view for hierarchy, drag-and-drop reorganization, bulk edit/delete operations, tag merging with redirect handling, usage statistics and trends, and audit trail. Include permission controls and validation rules.

## 5. Integrate tag filtering with search system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Enhance existing search functionality to support tag-based filtering, faceted search, and combined text/tag queries with proper indexing
### Details:
Modify search queries to include tag filters, implement faceted search UI with tag selection, create compound indexes for performance, support AND/OR/NOT tag operations, and integrate with existing filters. Include search result highlighting and tag-based recommendations.
