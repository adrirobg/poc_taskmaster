# TEP v2.4 Optimization Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-26  
**Branch:** test/tep-v23-real-execution → main  
**Result:** Successful optimization from deterministic script to flexible guide

## Problem Statement

TEP v2.3 had become an over-engineered implementation script (118 lines) that:
- Created files directly instead of planning
- Mixed enrichment with implementation
- Generated deterministic outputs instead of guiding reasoning

## Key Discovery

**Principle:** "The TEP is a guide for the LLM, not a deterministic algorithm"

This understanding shifted the entire approach from scripting to guidance.

## Optimization Journey

### v2.3 → v2.4.0 (Initial Fix)
- Removed implementation logic
- Switched from JSON to markdown artifacts
- Reduced from 118 to 77 lines (35% reduction)

### v2.4.0 → v2.4.1 (ULTRATHINK Test)
- Added ULTRATHINK mode
- Result: 87% larger artifacts with 40% over-engineering
- Introduced premature patterns ("unit of work")

### v2.4.1 → v2.4.3 (Final Optimization)
- Discovered 4 thinking modes: think, think hard, think harder, ultrathink
- Selected "think hard" as optimal balance
- Final artifact: 40 lines (most concise)
- TODOs: 12 focused vs 15 generic

## Technical Improvements

1. **Context7 Integration**
   - Identifies library IDs without premature fetching
   - Topics refined: "sqlite wal pragma" vs generic "engine configuration"
   - Trust scores prioritized

2. **Artifact Format**
   - Markdown over JSON for natural LLM processing
   - Structured with clear sections
   - No rigid schemas

3. **TODO Generation**
   - From 15 generic to 12 specific
   - Balanced distribution: Doc(33%), TDD(33%), Parallel(17%)
   - Each TODO has clear purpose

## Final Command Structure

```markdown
/task-enrich
- Activates "think hard" mode
- Follows 4 principles: Practical, Specific, Simple, 80/20
- Generates `.taskmaster/enriched/<id>-enriched.md`
- No implementation, only planning
```

## Metrics Comparison

| Version | Lines | TODOs | Over-engineering |
|---------|-------|-------|------------------|
| v2.3 | 118 | N/A | High |
| v2.4 (basic) | 48 | 15 | None |
| v2.4 (ultrathink) | 90 | 15 | 40% |
| v2.4.3 (think hard) | 40 | 12 | None |

## Key Files

- Command: `.claude/commands/task-enrich.md`
- Test artifacts: `.taskmaster/enriched/1-enriched*.md`
- Analysis logs: `logs/tep-analysis/`

## Next Steps

1. Test full workflow with implementation
2. Validate Context7 value during actual coding
3. Measure time savings from enriched planning

## Conclusion

TEP v2.4.3 achieves optimal balance:
- Concise yet comprehensive (40 lines)
- Detects important additions (Pydantic Settings)
- Avoids speculation and premature optimization
- Generates actionable, focused TODOs

The "think hard" mode provides the sweet spot between surface analysis and over-engineering.
